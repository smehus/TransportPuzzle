Make a collision manager component - to keep track of collisions. Right now I have two that do the same thing
Highlight the current tile standing on
make debug label to show movement vector / rotation degrees

Making animation keys attached to the enum cases
yellow grass like destiny
lights from below rocks? like destingy


Fix animations -> Getting these "*** fAILED REMOVING WALK ANIMATION Optional(SokobanCopy2.ControlDirection.top)""


checkout the fox game from apple and how they handle animation players -> Add a bunch and then just call play() / stop()
